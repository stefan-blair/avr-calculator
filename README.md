# avr-calculator

## synopsis
for this project, i built a four function calculator from scratch. i used 16 push-buttons linked together in a grid using diodes, and connected them to an ATMega324p micro-controller, which i programmed in C. i then 3D modeled a case for the calculator (admittedly, very large and bulky), which i then 3D printed using my schools printer. finally, i connected a 9V battery to a voltage regulator, and then to the micro-controller, to power it. i have been using it in school ever since.
